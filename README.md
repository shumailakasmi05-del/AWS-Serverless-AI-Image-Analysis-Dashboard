# AWS Serverless AI Image Analysis Platform

A serverless image analysis application built with AWS that automatically analyzes uploaded images using **Amazon Rekognition** and **Amazon Bedrock** and displays the results in a web dashboard.

## Project Overview

Users select an image from the web dashboard and upload it.

The application then:

1. Generates a secure **S3 presigned upload URL**
2. Uploads the image to an S3 `uploads/` folder
3. Automatically triggers an **AWS Lambda** function
4. Uses **Amazon Rekognition** to analyze the image
5. Uses **Amazon Bedrock** to generate an AI description
6. Saves the analysis as JSON in S3
7. Retrieves the results through **API Gateway**
8. Displays the results in the web dashboard

## AWS Services Used

| Service                | Purpose                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Amazon S3**          | Stores uploaded images and analysis results |
| **AWS Lambda**         | Runs the image processing and API logic     |
| **Amazon Rekognition** | Analyzes images                             |
| **Amazon Bedrock**     | Generates natural-language AI summaries     |
| **Amazon API Gateway** | Provides API endpoints for the dashboard    |
| **AWS IAM**            | Controls permissions between AWS services   |

## Image Analysis

Amazon Rekognition provides:

* Object and scene detection
* Face detection
* Estimated age range
* Gender estimation
* Smile detection
* Eye/mouth state
* Emotion detection
* OCR/text detection
* Content moderation

The application converts these results into a structured JSON report.

## AI Summary

The structured Rekognition results are sent to **Amazon Bedrock**.

Bedrock generates a human-readable description such as:

> "The image features a portrait of a happy man in his early thirties..."

This allows the application to combine traditional computer vision with generative AI.

## Security & AWS Architecture

The project uses:

* IAM roles for Lambda permissions
* S3 presigned URLs for browser uploads
* Private S3 objects
* API Gateway endpoints
* CORS configuration for browser communication
* S3 event-based Lambda processing

The browser does **not** receive AWS credentials.

Instead, the backend generates a temporary presigned URL that allows the browser to upload the selected image directly to S3.

### Frontend

**index.html**

* Dashboard structure
* Image upload interface
* Analysis sections

**style.css**

* Dashboard styling
* Responsive layout
* Cards and analysis sections

**app.js**

* Sends upload request to API Gateway
* Uploads image using the presigned S3 URL
* Polls for analysis results
* Displays the returned JSON data

## API Endpoints

### POST `/upload`

Creates a temporary S3 presigned URL.

Example request:

```json
{
  "filename": "example.jpg"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "upload_url": "https://...",
  "key": "uploads/unique-file-name.jpg",
  "filename": "unique-file-name.jpg"
}
```

### GET `/analysis`

Retrieves the completed analysis.

Example:

```text
GET /analysis?file=unique-file-name.jpg
```

## What I Learned

This project gave me hands-on experience with:

* Serverless AWS architecture
* Lambda functions
* S3 event triggers
* IAM permissions
* API Gateway
* Presigned S3 URLs
* Amazon Rekognition
* Amazon Bedrock
* REST API development
* CORS
* Asynchronous cloud processing
* Connecting a frontend application to AWS services

## Project Goal

The goal of this project was to build a practical serverless AI application using multiple AWS services together rather than using a single AI API.

It demonstrates how AWS services can be combined to create an automated, scalable image-processing workflow without managing servers.

## Technologies

**AWS:**
S3 • Lambda • API Gateway • Rekognition • Bedrock • IAM

**Frontend:**
HTML • CSS • JavaScript

**AI/ML:**
Computer Vision • OCR • Generative AI • Content Moderation

## Cost Note

This project uses AWS services that can incur charges depending on usage. Keep testing volumes small and monitor AWS billing when experimenting with the application.

### AWS Architecture

The AWS console was used to configure the Lambda functions, S3 event trigger, API Gateway routes, IAM permissions, and CORS settings.

### Example Analysis

The application produces a structured JSON report containing detected objects, facial attributes, detected text, safety results, and an AI-generated description.

```json
{
  "report_type": "AWS Image Analysis Report",
  "summary": {
    "description": "AI-generated image description"
  },
  "objects": {
    "count": 15
  },
  "faces": {
    "count": 1
  },
  "text": {
    "detected": false
  },
  "safety": {
    "status": "No Issues Detected"
  }
}
```

### How It Works

I chose S3 as the starting point because it provides durable object storage and can trigger Lambda when a new image is uploaded.

I used Rekognition for the initial structured image analysis and Bedrock to turn those structured results into a natural-language description.

API Gateway provides the interface between the browser and the AWS backend, while presigned S3 URLs allow the browser to upload images without exposing AWS credentials.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Browser CORS Error

**Problem:**
The dashboard initially failed when trying to communicate with the AWS API from the browser.

**Solution:**
Configured CORS in API Gateway to allow the dashboard to send GET, POST, and OPTIONS requests.

### Local Dashboard Security Error

**Problem:**
Opening `index.html` directly with `file://` caused browser security restrictions when calling the AWS API.

**Solution:**
Ran the dashboard through a local HTTP server using `http://localhost:8000`.

### Asynchronous Image Processing

**Problem:**
Image analysis does not complete instantly after an upload.

**Solution:**
The frontend periodically checks the API for the analysis result until processing is complete.

### Upload Security

**Problem:**
The browser should not contain AWS credentials.

**Solution:**
Created a Lambda function that generates temporary S3 presigned upload URLs.
